🦞 Introducing **Claw Control** — Kanban for AI Agents

Your AI agents are doing real work. They deserve a real dashboard.

Track tasks. Monitor status. Coordinate your AI team.

Open source. MIT licensed. Built for the agentic era.

## Tweet 2: The Problem (276 chars)

**The problem:**

You've got AI agents running tasks—Claude, GPT, custom bots.

But where do they report? How do you know what's working on what?

Console logs? Scattered Discord messages? Chaos.

Your agents need a mission control. Now they have one.
